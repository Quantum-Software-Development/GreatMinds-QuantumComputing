1. **Max Planck** (1900) üåå  

    - **Formula**:
  
   $\color{Green} {\huge   E = h \nu   }$
  
   - **Explanation**: Planck introduced the idea that energy is emitted in discrete quantities, called "quanta." His theory was the first step toward modern quantum physics.
   - 
   - **Contribution**: Known as the "father of quantum theory," his discovery opened the door to quantum physics.

3. **Albert Einstein** (1905) üí°  
   - **Formula**: \( E_k = h \nu - \phi \)  
   - **Explanation**: Through the photoelectric effect, Einstein proposed that light behaves as particles (photons) with quantized energy, challenging the classical view of light as just a wave.
   - **Contribution**: His ideas on wave-particle duality were crucial for modern physics, laying the foundation for quantum mechanics.
  
     

4. **Niels Bohr** (1913) üî¨  
   - **Formula**: \( E_n = -\frac{Z^2 R_H}{n^2} \)  
   - **Explanation**: Bohr's model described the quantized energy levels of electrons within atoms, particularly hydrogen.
   - **Contribution**: His theory advanced atomic physics, leading to the concept of complementarity in quantum mechanics.

5. **Werner Heisenberg** (1927) üéØ  
   - **Formula**: \( \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \)  
   - **Explanation**: The uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously determine a particle‚Äôs position and momentum with absolute precision.
   - **Contribution**: This principle reshaped our understanding of quantum nature, showing that particle behavior remains indeterminate until observed.

Schr√∂dinger is also famous for his thought experiment known as **Schr√∂dinger's cat**, where a hypothetical cat can be in both "alive" and "dead" states simultaneously until observed. This experiment illustrates the concept of quantum superposition and highlights the paradoxes in interpreting quantum mechanics.
     
   - **Contribution**: Schr√∂dinger is known for his contribution to quantum mechanics theory, particularly through introducing the wave function, which provides a probabilistic description of particle behavior.
